      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Gather Materials:</b> Collect all the materials and tools you'll
          need for building the birdhouse.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Design the Birdhouse:</b> Decide on the dimensions and design of
          your birdhouse. A simple design could include a rectangular box with a
          slanted roof. A typical birdhouse could have dimensions of
          approximately 6x6x8 inches.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cut the Wood:</b> Using a saw, cut the 1x6 inch wood board into the
          necessary pieces: two sides, a front, a back, a bottom, and a roof.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Sand the Edges:</b> Use sandpaper to smooth out the edges of the
          cut pieces to prevent splinters and ensure a neat finish.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Assemble the Box:</b> Lay out the pieces to form the basic box
          shape. Apply wood glue to the edges of the sides, front, and back,
          then carefully attach them. Use clamps to hold the pieces in place
          while the glue dries. You can also reinforce the joints with nails or
          screws.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Attach the Bottom:</b> Apply wood glue to the bottom edges of the
          box and attach the bottom piece. Secure it with nails or screws for
          extra stability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Add the Roof:</b> Attach the roof piece to the top of the box. Make
          sure it overhangs the front of the box slightly to provide some
          protection from rain. Secure it with nails or screws.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Drill the Entry Hole:</b> Depending on the type of birds you want
          to attract, drill a hole near the top of the front piece for the entry
          hole. Different bird species have different preferences for entry hole
          size.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Decorate and Paint (Optional):</b> If desired, you can add some
          decorative elements to the birdhouse. Make sure to use bird-safe paint
          and finishes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Attach a Hanger:</b> Screw or nail a small piece of wood to the top
          back of the birdhouse to create a hanger. This will allow you to hang
          the birdhouse from a tree branch, hook, or post.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Install the Birdhouse:</b> Find a suitable location for your
          birdhouse. Make sure it's in a quiet and somewhat sheltered area, away
          from heavy human activity and potential predators.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Enjoy Watching the Birds:</b> Once the birdhouse is securely hung,
          all that's left to do is wait and enjoy watching the birds that might
          choose to make it their home.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Tips:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Research the types of birds in your area to design the birdhouse to
          their preferences.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid using pressure-treated wood or toxic finishes that could be
          harmful to birds.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clean out the birdhouse at the end of each nesting season to prepare
          for the next year's inhabitants.
        </li>
      </ul>
